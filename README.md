Demand forecasting is crucial in Supply Chain Management, aiding planners in predicting future sales patterns. Analyzing a dataset from a USA lighting manufacturer (Nov 2013 to Aug 2017), the focus is on SKU patterns, including NPI, seasonal, growing trends, declining trends, and sparse data products. Time Series (TS) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed, with an ensemble approach enhancing accuracy for various patterns. However, for sparse data products, the ensemble may be less effective due to limited sales data.

Introduction:

In the dynamic business landscape, effective data processing and forecasting are essential for sustained success. This document aims to create a real-time application for demand forecasting, leveraging time series, regression, machine learning, and ensemble algorithms.

Research Question:

To what extent can the proposed decision integration strategy forecast different sales patterns of products/SKUs (sparsely products, new introduction products, seasonal products, and seasonal damping products) using time series (AR, ARMA, ARIMA, SMA, SES, HWES) and machine learning algorithms (lr, lasso, en, ridge, llars, pa, cart, knn) through an ensemble approach (ada, bag, rf, et, gbm) without compromising accuracy and cyclicity?

The need for accurate forecasting is highlighted during festive seasons and various product trends, necessitating diverse algorithms. Our model accommodates these patterns efficiently, providing the best forecast accuracy.
